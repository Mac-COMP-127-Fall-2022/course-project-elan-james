Project description:
    This is a pinball game with fun colors and mostly working game physics!
Give a brief technical guide to running your code:
    It requires Java 17, 
How should somebody run the program? Where is the main class?
    Acknowledge any help, references, inspiration, or outside resources you used. If your game includes any art or sound assets, or includes the work of others in any way, credit the creator(s) and link to the source(s).
Known issues:
    Are there fundamental design limitations that users should be aware of?
    Are there specific bugs, glitches, or shortcomings that users should be aware of?
Societal impact:
    Please write about how your project abides by ethical considerations and socially responsible computing practices. Be mindful that anything created by humans, including software, can carry embedded biases and have unintended consequences. In every software project, you must consider the ways in which your program can promote justice or heighten injustices, either through unintentional effects or through malicious misuse.

This may seem like an odd question. For example, Breakout cannot possibly have negative consequencesâ€¦right? It is just a game, and such a simple little game at that! But can a blind person play it? What about somebody who uses an assistive device instead of a mouse?
