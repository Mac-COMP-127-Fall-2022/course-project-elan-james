# Pinball fields

Elan Levin and James McCarthy 

Project description:
    This is a pinball game with fun colors and mostly working game physics!
Brief technical guide to running Pinball fields:
    It requires Java 17, it runs in vs code and uses kilt graphics and the macalester specific library.

How to run the program:
    The main class is found at the bottom of the Pinball file. 
Known issues:
    Our limited programming abilities heavily restricted our ability to make the game physics flawless. The ball often gets trapped bouncing inside of the walls or reflectors, and can pass through the bottom of the flippers relatively easily. The game doesn't do anything once you've lost all your lives. Points are added during glitches. This program can be extremely laggy as a lot of the physics we used was suboptimal based on our code restrictions. 
Societal impact:
    While our game has no sound, it is heavily reliant on visual cues, and can't be played by those who are blind, visually impaired, are sensitive to bright light and therefore carries and an ability bias by nature. The game is also quite taxing on it's home system which carries all related costs/impacts associated.
